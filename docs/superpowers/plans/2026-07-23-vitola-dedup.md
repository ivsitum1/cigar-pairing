# Plan: iron out duplicate / wrong vitolas (multi-agent)

Date: 2026-07-23
Trigger: La Galera Connecticut shows `No.4` **and** `Connecticut No.4`, `Pegador`
**and** `Connecticut Pegador`, `Churchill` **and** `Churchill Tabaquero
Presidente`, plus `Half Corona` and `Corona` with **identical** dimensions
(46×89mm). Samplers show both `Robusto` and `Robusto Sampler` (and `Toro` /
`Toro Sampler`) — a needless split pointing at the same SKU.

## Root cause (verified in data)

These are **not** distinct vitolas. They are the **same shop product ingested
twice** — once from the `/en/` page and once from the `/hr/` page of
humidor.hr — with the vitola name parsed differently each time:

| vitola A (en) | vitola B (hr) | product URL (after locale strip) |
|---|---|---|
| `No.4` | `Connecticut No.4` | `…/proizvod/la-galera-connecticut-bonchero-no-4-…` |
| `Pegador` | `Connecticut Pegador` | `…/proizvod/la-galera-connecticut-pegador` |
| `Churchill Tabaquero Presidente` | `Churchill` | `…/proizvod/la-galera-connecticut-churchill-tabaquero-…` |
| `Half Corona` | `Corona` | `…/proizvod/la-galera-connecticut-half-corona-3-…` |

The `Corona` row is not a real Corona — it is the hr twin of **Half Corona**,
which is why the dimensions are identical. There is no separate Corona SKU.

Why dedup misses them: the engine keys a vitola on `(vitola_name, ring, lmm)`
(`build-market-cigars.py:407`). The en/hr titles yield different
`vitola_name`, so the twins get different keys and both survive. The app-side
`uniqueVitolas` also dedups by **name**, so it can't catch them either.

These duplicate entries live in the **base catalog** (`catalogSource != "market"`)
as well as in engine output, so the fix must run over the **whole** `cigars.json`
(base + market), idempotently.

## Scope (measured on cigars.json, 3105 cigars / 5680 vitolas)

- **Locale-twin extra vitolas: 78 across 60 cigars.** Deterministic to detect
  (URL identical after locale strip). Highest-leverage, zero-network fix.
- **Name-prefix dupes at identical dims+price: 74.** e.g. `Gran Robusto` vs
  `Robusto`. Some are real different sizes, some are twins — need adjudication.
- **Sampler self-splits: 3** (La Galera Robusto Sampler, La Galera Toro
  Sampler, Oliva Robusto Sampler).

## Guiding rules (all streams)

1. **Deterministic + idempotent.** Same input → byte-identical output. The
   normalize pass must be safe to re-run after every engine build.
2. **Never invent data.** Merging keeps real values; ambiguous cases are
   *flagged*, not auto-merged.
3. **Own distinct files.** Each stream writes its own data/decision file so
   agents run in parallel without collisions. Stream A consumes the others'
   outputs when present, and works standalone without them.
4. **Regression-guarded.** Integrity tests must fail if a locale-twin or
   sampler self-split reappears.

---

## Stream A — Deterministic vitola dedup pass  ·  no network  ·  owner: core agent (Claude)

Build `app/scripts/normalize-vitolas.py`, idempotent, run after the engine
(`build-market-cigars.py --phase all && normalize-vitolas.py`). It rewrites
`cigars.json` in place and emits `app/scripts/output/vitola_dedup_audit.json`.

Responsibilities (only the deterministic, no-data-needed parts):

1. **Locale-twin collapse.** Group a cigar's vitolas by locale-normalized
   product URL: strip `/(hr|en)/proizvod/` → `/proizvod/`, `cigarworld.de/(en|de)/`
   → `cigarworld.de/`, trailing slash. Vitolas sharing a normalized URL are one
   vitola → merge: union `regionLinks`, prefer a real (non-`—`) `format`, keep
   `burnTime`-derived `smokeTimeMin`, prefer the HR product URL/price.
2. **Canonical name choice** for a merged group: pick the candidate name with
   the most token overlap with the product **slug tail** (slug minus brand+line
   tokens); tiebreak = shorter name. (Verified: yields `Half Corona`,
   `Churchill Tabaquero Presidente`, `No.4`, `Pegador`.) If Stream B's
   `vitola_lexicon` provides a canonical for the slug, that wins.
3. **Sampler self-vitola collapse.** For a line whose name/vitola contains
   `Sampler`/`Gift`, collapse to a single representative vitola (drop the row
   whose name just repeats the line, e.g. `Robusto Sampler`). Contents already
   live in `lineup`.
4. **Consume adjudications** (when present): apply Stream C
   `vitola_dedup_decisions.json` (merge/keep) and Stream D
   `dimension_fixes.json` (corrected ring×length).
5. **Audit + flag.** Write every merge and every *unresolved* prefix-dup
   suspect to the audit file for Streams C/D to pick up.

Deliverable: script + wiring + `vitola_dedup_audit.json`. Fixes the 78 twins
and 3 samplers immediately, no external input.

## Stream B — Vitola name lexicon / canonicalization  ·  data  ·  split by brand range

Curate `app/scripts/data/vitola_lexicon.json` additions: slug-token → canonical
vitola display name, and a locale-title alias list, so names come out
consistent across en/hr and across brands. Feeds Stream A step 2. Divide by
brand range (A–F / G–M / N–Z). Output: lexicon entries only — no code.

## Stream C — Prefix-dup adjudication  ·  data + light network  ·  split by brand range

Work the 74 `same-dims+price, name is prefix/superset` pairs from the audit.
For each, decide **merge** (twin) or **keep-both** (genuinely different size —
verify against the shop page). Emit `app/scripts/data/vitola_dedup_decisions.json`:
`{ "<cigarId>": { "merge": [["Gran Robusto","Robusto"]], "keep": [...] } }`.
Split by brand range. Consumed by Stream A step 4.

## Stream D — Wrong / missing dimensions  ·  network scrape  ·  split by brand range

Re-validate vitolas with `format:"—"` (e.g. La Galera `Connecticut Chaveta`) or
dimensions that look copied/implausible. Pull correct ring×length from the shop
product page. Emit `app/scripts/data/dimension_fixes.json`:
`{ "<cigarId>::<vitolaName>": { "ring": 50, "lmm": 130 } }`. Consumed by Stream
A step 4. This is the only stream that needs live network (Cursor/local agent).

## Stream E — App-side safety net + display  ·  frontend  ·  one agent

- Harden `app/src/lib/cigarVitola.ts::uniqueVitolas` to also dedup by
  locale-normalized URL and by `(ring,lmm,price)` as a runtime guard.
- Ensure sampler cards never render a self-repeating vitola row.
- No data edits; pure defensive UI so a stray twin never reaches the screen.

## Stream F — Regression guard  ·  tests  ·  fold into E or standalone

Add to `app/src/data/integrity.test.ts`:
- No cigar has two vitolas with the same locale-normalized product URL.
- A `Sampler`/`Gift` line has exactly one vitola.
- No two vitolas share `(format, priceEUR)` **and** a prefix/superset name
  unless whitelisted in `vitola_dedup_decisions.json` `keep`.

## Sequencing

1. **A ships first** (locale-twin + sampler) — fixes the screenshot cases with
   zero external input; add F guards in the same PR.
2. **B, C, D run in parallel** (independent files). As each lands, re-run A to
   fold results in — output stays deterministic.
3. **E** any time (independent, defensive).

## Round 2 (2026-07-23 pm) — links wrong, semantic dupes, duplicate lines

New reports (Oliva): Serie V / Melanio buy links all wrong — humidor opens
Serie **O**, Holt's the homepage/category, CigarWorld finds nothing, Cigars
Daily lands on Serie V; Monticello / Monticello Double the same. Serie V also
lists `Belicoso`, `V Belicoso` and `Serie V Belicoso` (same cigar), and exists
as two lines (`Serie V` and `Serie V / Melanio`).

Diagnosis:
- **Semantic vitola dupes** — same vitola named with/without a redundant
  brand/line/series prefix. Not locale twins (no shared URL), so Round-1 dedup
  missed them.
- **Listing URLs masquerading as per-vitola links** — one shop URL
  (`holts.com/.../oliva-monticello.html`) is attached to every vitola *and* to
  both Monticello and Monticello Double. It's a category page, not a product.
  Measured: **100 region URLs reused across ≥2 cigars.**
- **Search-fallback mis-hits** — when a line has no product URL, the app builds
  a shop search from `brand + line` that returns the wrong product (Serie V
  Melanio → Serie O).
- **Duplicate lines** — `Serie V` ⊂ `Serie V / Melanio`, `Monticello` ⊂
  `Monticello Double`. Measured **622 prefix-overlap suspects** (noisy: `Flor de`
  ⊂ `Flor de Connecticut` etc. are genuinely distinct — adjudication needed).

### Stream G — semantic within-line dedup + link audit ✅ done (core agent)
`normalize-vitolas.py` now also collapses vitolas equal after stripping a
LEADING run of brand/line tokens (`Serie V Belicoso` → `Belicoso`,
`Epicure No. 2` → `Epicure No.2`). Guards: single-char tokens kept (Siglo I ≠
Siglo V), and never merge when real dimensions conflict (kept + flagged). 18
safe merges applied. Emits audit sections `semantic_merges`, `prefix_suspects`,
`shared_region_urls` (100), `duplicate_line_suspects` (622) as the worklist
below. Also: `applyVitola` now shows ONLY the chosen vitola (picking Robusto no
longer reopens the full vitola list).

### Stream H — per-vitola / per-product URL correctness · network · by shop×brand
Work `vitola_dedup_audit.json → shared_region_urls`. For each reused URL, find
the real per-size product page where the shop has one; where the shop only
offers a line/category page, mark that link **line-level (not exact)** so the app
stops claiming it's the specific vitola. Fix by editing the raw unified catalog
(the engine's pinned input) and re-running `build-market-cigars.py --phase all`,
which now ends with `normalize-vitolas.py`. Split by shop (Holt's / CigarWorld /
humidor+havana) and brand range.

### Stream I — wrong-product-match verification · network · by brand range
Lines with no product URL where the search fallback mis-hits (e.g. Serie V
Melanio → Serie O). Verify the correct product URL and add it to the raw
catalog; if no product page exists, leave it (the search fallback is honest) but
note it. Split by brand range.

### Stream J — duplicate-line adjudication · data + light network · by brand range
Work `vitola_dedup_audit.json → duplicate_line_suspects`. Decide per pair:
merge (same line, e.g. `Serie V` + `Serie V / Melanio`) or distinct (`Flor de`
family). For merges, name the canonical line id and fold vitolas in. Output
`app/scripts/data/line_merge_decisions.json`
(`{ "<canonicalId>": { "absorb": ["<otherId>"] } }`). High false-positive rate —
this is judgement work, not a blind rule.

### Stream E (frontend safety net) — updated
> Also: `uniqueVitolas` already dedups by product URL (Round 1). Confirm sampler
> and chosen-vitola display shows a single row.
